👋 Hello World! I'm Bozhidara Bozhanova, a recent graduate from Technical University Varna with a degree in Computer Systems and Technology. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey as a student at SoftUni, pursuing my passion for becoming a Front-end Developer.

🎓 Graduating this year has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer systems, and my ongoing studies at SoftUni are honing my skills in web development. I'm enthusiastic about creating delightful and user-friendly interfaces that bring digital experiences to life.

🚀 On my way to realizing my dream as a Front-end Developer, I'm diving into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies and frameworks.

🍰 When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the kitchen baking delicious cakes and sweets. It's not just a hobby; it's a sweet escape from lines of code, bringing creativity and joy into my life.
